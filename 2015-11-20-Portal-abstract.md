**Unmediated: focusing upon the user experience by reorganizing for opportunity and greater capacity**

Wheaton College's Buswell Library planned and executed a re-organization in 2011 to move from a traditional library structure (e.g. Public and Technical Services) to new groupings of library functions and cross-library teams. This facilitated a reorientation of the library?s focus outward to the user, enhanced alignment to the institution?s instructional mission, eliminate unnecessary barriers and mediation, and furthered engagement in the complexities of the information ecosystem. The re-organization?s journey from inputs to outputs to outcomes established a new foundation for the library to expand and enhance user instruction, embrace demand-driven acquisition and pay-per-view journal access, enable user-initiated room scheduling, and facilitate on-campus book delivery to faculty. Unique efforts included realignment of staff to provide more instruction and subject liaison efforts, a management team approach coupled with team assignments, and flexibility in decision-making.
